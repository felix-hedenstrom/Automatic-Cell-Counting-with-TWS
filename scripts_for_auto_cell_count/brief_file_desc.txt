BS_TWS_apply – A BeanShell script that applies multiple Weka classifiers over a single set of validation data and saves output in specified folders

classifier_comparison – R script for statistical comparison between classifiers on validation data

count_from_roi – Simple ImageJ macro script to record total objects (eg. Hand placed markers or cell segmentation objects) within images

full dataset process – R script for statistical comparison of hand counts on full dataset

Full dataset counting – R script for counting auto generated object segmentations and performing T test of cell count by genotype

generate geno file – R script that was used with our full dataset to generate the geno file used

just_thresh - simple macro to threshold Weka output images into 8 bit binary

projecting images – R script used on our image segmentations which needed to be overlapped before final counting

Processing_and_norm - histogram normalization for all images

count_over_dir – ImageJ macro to generate count results.csv files for multiple classifiers. Compares cell segmentation objects with hand placed markers for cell counting.
